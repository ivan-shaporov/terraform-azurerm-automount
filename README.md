# terraform-azurerm-automount




## Automount managed disks

This module creates a VM and automaticallymounts managed disks. 

## Usage


```hcl
resource "random_id" "rg_name" {
  byte_length = 8
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "${random_id.rg_name.hex}"
  location = "${var.location}"
}

module "vm-with-provisioner" {
  source              = "../.."
  location            = "${var.location}"
  vm_os_simple        = "UbuntuServer"
  public_ip_dns       = ["testautomount"] // change to a unique name per datacenter region
  public_ip_address_allocation = "static" // workaround for the issue with vm dynamic IP-s
  vnet_subnet_id      = "${module.network.vnet_subnets[0]}"
  ssh_key             = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" 
  private_ssh_key     = "~/.ssh/id_rsa" 
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.rg.name}"
}

module "network" {
  source              = "Azure/network/azurerm"
  version             = "~> 1.1.1"
  location            = "${var.location}"
  allow_rdp_traffic   = "true"
  allow_ssh_traffic   = "true"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.rg.name}"
}
